# Changelog

All notable changes to the Prototyper Story Schema are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Schema versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## [Unreleased]

Planned for future versions:

- `prototyper migrate --from 1.0 --to 1.1` — CLI migration tool to add empty `acceptance_criteria: []` arrays to existing `stories.yaml` files.
- Story Guard community ports — Windsurf, Aider, GitHub Copilot (BYOK), Continue.dev. Claude Code ✅ and Cursor ✅ are already documented in [STORY_GUARD.md](./STORY_GUARD.md).

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-04

Minor version. Backwards-compatible additions.

### Added

- **`tags`** — Free-form labels for cross-cutting concerns. Array of lowercase alphanumeric strings (hyphens allowed, max 20 tags, max 64 chars each, unique per story). Use for delivery milestones (`mvp`, `wave-2`), platform variants (`mobile`, `api`), quality dimensions (`a11y`, `perf`, `security`), or ad-hoc groupings. Tooling: `locus list --tag <tag>` filter; GitHub Action can gate on tag coverage.
- **`persona`** — The user role this story is written for. Single string, max 128 chars. Distinct from `assignee` (implementer) — `persona` is who benefits. Split stories that serve multiple personas. Null for system-level stories.
- **`risk`** — Risk assessment sub-object. Fields: `level` (required: `critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`), `category` (enum), `description` (what could go wrong), `mitigation` (what is being done), `review_ref` (URI). `description` and `mitigation` required by convention for `high`/`critical` stories — tooling should warn when absent.
- **`non_functional`** — Story-level non-functional requirements sub-object. Fields: `performance` (PerformanceNFR sub-object with `p50_ms`, `p95_ms`, `p99_ms`, `max_ms`, `throughput_rps`, `budget_note`), `availability` (SLO string), `accessibility` (WCAG level enum: `WCAG-2.0-A` through `WCAG-2.2-AAA`), `data_retention` (ISO 8601 duration or policy string), `security` (freeform), `notes` (freeform). All fields optional — only include story-specific constraints; project-wide defaults live in project documentation.

### Backwards compatibility

All additions are optional fields. Files valid against v1.1 are valid against v1.2. Readers that handle unknown fields gracefully (as specified in the v1.1 reader contract) need no changes. The `schema_version` field in files should be bumped to `"1.2"` when the new fields are used.

---

## [1.1.5] — 2026-05-03

Documentation patch. No schema changes.

### Documentation

- `SCHEMA.md`: added **The `story_id` field** section — full authoring guidance covering:
  - Format convention: `<PREFIX>-<NUMBER>` pattern with 2–8 uppercase ASCII letter prefix and zero-padded integer.
  - Prefix guideline table (US, AUTH, PAY, DASH, API, ADMIN, PERF, INFRA and open convention).
  - Uniqueness rules: MUST be unique within a file (validation error on duplicate); RECOMMENDED unique across files in a repo (warn on collision).
  - Stability rules: `story_id` MUST NOT change once assigned; how to handle reorganisation (deprecate old, create new).
  - Numbering guidance: sequential within prefix, gaps permitted, never renumber existing stories.
  - Tooling rules: validators MUST reject duplicates and invalid cross-file `depends_on`; SHOULD warn on non-conforming IDs and `depends_on` pointing to `deprecated` stories.
- Version header bumped to v1.1.5.

### Rationale

`story_id` is the primary human-readable identifier in the spec — it appears in `depends_on` arrays, PR messages, CI output, and test annotations — but had only a one-line comment in the Story object type signature with no conventions documented. Real usage showed teams using inconsistent formats (`US1`, `story-auth-01`, `Feature_3`), IDs changing when stories were reordered, and `depends_on` references breaking silently. This patch establishes clear authoring conventions and makes uniqueness/stability into hard tooling rules so validators can enforce them.

---

## [1.1.4] — 2026-05-03

Schema consistency fix. No new fields or behaviour changes.

### Fixed

- **Story object TypeScript type** (`SCHEMA.md`, Story object section): `status` enum was missing `"deprecated"`. The value was documented in the Status values table and semantics section (added in v1.1.2) but the type signature still read `"not-implemented" | "partial" | "implemented" | "stale"`. Now reads `"not-implemented" | "partial" | "implemented" | "stale" | "deprecated"`.
- **JSON Schema** (`schema/v1.1/stories.schema.json`, `$defs.Story.properties.status.enum`): same omission — `"deprecated"` was missing from the machine-readable enum. A validator running against the JSON Schema would incorrectly reject any story with `status: deprecated` as invalid. Array now includes `"deprecated"`.

### Rationale

The `deprecated` status value was introduced in v1.1.2 with full documentation (semantics, decision guide, state machine transitions, tooling rules) but was not added to the two authoritative type definitions — the TypeScript signature in SCHEMA.md and the JSON Schema file. Any tool or linter using `schema/v1.1/stories.schema.json` for validation would have rejected `deprecated` stories as invalid, directly contradicting the documented spec. This patch closes the gap.

---

## [1.1.3] — 2026-05-03

Documentation patch. No schema changes.

### Documentation

- `SCHEMA.md`: added **The `notes` field** section — full authoring guidance covering: what belongs in `notes` (rationale, scope exclusions, ADR links, implementation constraints, deferred items); what does NOT belong (observable behaviour, acceptance criteria, implementation detail without constraint); why `notes` is excluded from Story Guard scope-checking by design; and a worked example (`PERF-03`) demonstrating the separation between `description`/`acceptance_criteria` (observable, testable) and `notes` (rationale, constraints).
- Version header bumped to v1.1.3.

### Rationale

The `notes` field was introduced in v1.1.0 and noted in a one-line comment in the Story object type signature, but had no authoring guidance. Real usage showed teams putting implementation rationale, ADR links, and scope exclusions into `description` — which degrades Story Guard's scope-checking accuracy because the LLM reads `description` as the behavioural contract. The fix is clear separation: `description` = what users can do/see; `acceptance_criteria` = how you verify it; `notes` = everything else. This patch makes that separation explicit and illustrates it with a worked example.

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-05-03

Documentation patch. No schema changes.

### Documentation

- `SCHEMA.md`: expanded **Status values** section with precise semantics for all five values, decision guides (when to use each value, what not to use it for), and a complete status transition diagram.
- `SCHEMA.md`: added `deprecated` status value — for features intentionally removed from the product. Distinguished from `stale` (unknown state) vs `deprecated` (intentionally removed). Deprecated stories retain their `story_id` permanently.
- `SCHEMA.md`: added three tooling-SHOULD rules: warn on `partial` stories > 30 days; warn on `stale` stories referenced in open PRs; warn on `implemented` → `deprecated` transitions without a `notes` entry.
- Version header bumped to v1.1.2.

### Rationale

The status table had one-line definitions that didn't distinguish edge cases: what happens when a feature is removed? When does `stale` resolve? How long can a story be `partial`? Real usage showed authors working around the ambiguity — leaving stories as `stale` indefinitely or using `not-implemented` for removed features. This patch closes the semantic gaps. `deprecated` is added as a documentation-only value (no JSON Schema change required — it is an allowed string value; tooling that handles unknown enum values will surface it correctly until a formal schema patch ships).

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-03

Documentation patch. No schema changes.

### Documentation

- `SCHEMA.md`: added **Compliance object** section — TypeScript-style type signature, field reference table, YAML example (PSD2 payment story), and four authoring rules:
  - `approved_by` and `approved_at` are required when the `compliance` block is present.
  - `audit_note` SHOULD reference the specific regulatory article or control.
  - Tooling MUST warn when a `stale` story carries a `compliance` block (re-approval required).
  - The `compliance` block MUST NOT be used as a placeholder — it signals sign-off has occurred.
- Version header bumped to v1.1.1.

### Rationale

The `compliance` field was introduced in v1.1.0 and documented in the JSON Schema (`$defs/Compliance`), but the human-readable `SCHEMA.md` only noted its existence in a one-line comment. Integrators building regulated-sector tooling had no field-level documentation. This patch closes that gap.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-03

Quality contract fields and reduced friction for hand-authored files.

### Schema changes (stories.schema.json)

- **New file**: `schema/v1.1/stories.schema.json` — full JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12) for v1.1.
- **New story fields (all optional)**:
  - `acceptance_criteria` (`string[] | null`) — human-readable, testable done-conditions. Not BDD/Gherkin. Enables deterministic Story Guard scope checking and precise audit validation instead of AI inference from `description`.
  - `depends_on` (`string[] | null`) — list of `story_id` values that must be implemented before this story. Allows tooling and CI to surface unmet dependencies.
  - `design_ref` (`string | null`) — URI to the Figma frame, mockup, or design token set for this story.
  - `test_refs` (`string[] | null`) — explicit test file paths (optionally with line anchors) that verify this story. Makes `audit_stories()` deterministic: check these files rather than inferring from code search.
  - `compliance` (`Compliance | null`) — formal approval block. Previously undocumented in schema; now formally specified. Subfields: `approved_by`, `approved_at` (required); `review_ref`, `audit_note` (optional).
  - `notes` (`string | null`) — freetext author rationale, scope exclusions, ADR links, implementation constraints. Distinct from `description` (observable behaviour).
- **New root field (optional)**:
  - `exported_at` (`date-time | null`) — ISO 8601 timestamp of when the file was generated by the platform API or CLI. Absent in hand-authored files. Already present in MCP server output; now formally specified.
- **Relaxed required fields on Story**: `id`, `section`, `priority`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `version` are now optional. They were required in v1.0 but real usage showed hand-authored files almost never include them. Platform-generated files still include all fields.
- **Relaxed required fields on Project**: `id` and `created_at` are now optional. `name` is the only required field.
- **New `$defs/Compliance`** sub-schema — extracted to `$defs` for reuse and clarity.

### CI workflow

- Updated `validate-schema.yml`: job renamed to "Validate against schema v1.1".
- Workflow now auto-selects schema version: files with `schema_version: 1.0.x` validate against `schema/v1.0/stories.schema.json`; files with `schema_version: 1.1+` validate against `schema/v1.1/stories.schema.json`. This preserves v1.0 backwards compatibility in CI.

### Documentation

- `SCHEMA.md` bumped to v1.1. Updated story object type signature, project object type signature, root object, examples (JSON + YAML + minimal hand-authored).
- Added minimal hand-authored YAML example showing the new 4-field minimum.

### Design decisions

**Why relax required fields?**  
The v1.0 schema required `id`, `section`, `priority`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `version`. Real usage showed that teams hand-authoring `stories.yaml` hit validation errors immediately on minimal files (the example `stories.yaml` in both `prototyper/examples/` used only `story_id`, `title`, `description`, `section`, `status`). The distinction that matters is: platform-generated files (via API export or CLI) always have all fields; hand-authored files need only the semantic minimum. V1.1 encodes this distinction explicitly.

**Why is `acceptance_criteria` plain English, not BDD/Gherkin?**  
Gherkin requires a testing framework to be useful; plain English does not. The goal is a human-readable contract that a QA engineer can verify and that Story Guard can scope-check without a parser. Gherkin can be added as an `x-gherkin` extension by tools that need it.

**Why is `notes` a separate field from `description`?**  
`description` is the observable behaviour spec — what a user does or sees. `notes` is author commentary: why we built it this way, what we considered and rejected, links to ADRs or Slack threads. Mixing them into `description` degrades Story Guard's scope-checking accuracy because LLMs treat the entire field as the story contract.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-24

Initial stable release of the Prototyper Story Schema.

### Schema (stories.schema.json)

- **Root object**: `schema_version` (string, required), `project` (object, required), `stories` (array, required).
- **Project object**: `id` (UUID, required), `name` (string, required), `created_at` (ISO 8601, required).
- **Story object**: 10 required fields + 4 optional fields. `additionalProperties: false` — no undeclared fields accepted.
  - Required: `id`, `story_id`, `title`, `description`, `section`, `status`, `priority`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `version`
  - Optional: `assignee`, `reviewer`, `pr_refs`, `jira_key`
- **Status enum**: `not-implemented | partial | implemented | stale`
  - `stale`: computed by `audit_stories()` when source files change after an `implemented` verdict. Not hand-set.
- **Priority**: integer 0–3. `0`=urgent, `1`=high, `2`=medium, `3`=low.
- **Stable IDs**: `id` is a UUID that never changes, even if `title` or `story_id` changes. Used as the stable reference in commit messages, PR descriptions, CI logs, and audit reports. `story_id` is human-readable and may change.
- **Version**: integer, starts at 1, increments on every mutation. Enables drift detection by audit tooling.

### Added (2026-04-24 — initial commit, fc9481f)

- `SCHEMA.md` — full specification with TypeScript-style type signatures and field-level documentation.
- `examples/leave-management.json` — reference example: two stories (implemented + partial), realistic UUIDs and timestamps.
- `examples/leave-management.yaml` — YAML equivalent of the reference example.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guide: bug fixes to the specification, new optional fields (with use-case requirements), validator improvements, integration examples.
- `LICENSE` — MIT.
- `README.md` — quickstart, field table, integration table (Prototyper, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Actions), JSON Schema reference, API, versioning contract.

### Added (2026-04-25 — feat(schema): formal JSON Schema, 36f850e)

- `schema/v1.0/stories.schema.json` — machine-readable JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12). Validates the full root object including nested `project` and `stories` array. Used in editor autocomplete, CI workflows, and by the MCP server.
- `examples/leave-management.yaml` — YAML example updated to include all required fields.

### Added (2026-04-25 — feat(claude-code): story-implementer agent, 640a0bb)

- `.claude/agents/story-implementer.md` — Claude Code sub-agent template. Reads active sprint from Prototyper, implements to story `description`, marks story `implemented` on completion. Appears in Claude Code's `/` agent picker.
- `.claude/commands/check-story.md` — `/check-story` slash command: calls `get_active_story()` on demand and surfaces the story's description as a scope reminder.
- `CLAUDE.md` — project context for Claude Code: schema overview, tool list, Story Guard setup reminder. Read automatically by Claude Code at session start.

### Added (2026-04-26 — feat(plugin): Claude Code plugin structure, d3bc9f5)

- `.claude/settings.json` — Claude Code plugin config. Wires `get_active_story()` as a `PostToolUse` hook: after every file write, bash command, or MCP tool call, the hook calls `get_active_story()` and the agent checks its action scope against the active story's `description`.
- `.claude-plugin/` — self-hosted plugin manifest. Enables `/plugin marketplace add jonybur/locus-story-schema` install path.
- `.mcp.json` — MCP server config. Points to `@prototyper/mcp-server`.
- `marketplace.json` — plugin marketplace entry for Claude Code.
- `skills/` — write-story and sync-stories skill templates.

### Added (2026-04-30 — docs: CLAUDE.md export guide, 36454cd)

- `README.md` updated: CLAUDE.md export documented as a first-class zero-setup path alongside the MCP server. Comparison table (CLAUDE.md export vs. MCP server). Hybrid pattern documented: CLAUDE.md for planning context + `get_active_story()` for per-action Story Guard. The two are compatible.

### Added (2026-04-30 — ci: GitHub Actions validation workflow, e606683)

- `.github/workflows/validate-stories.yml` — validates `stories.yaml` against the JSON Schema v1.0 on every push or PR touching `stories.yaml`. Requires no Prototyper account; fetches schema from GitHub raw URL. Uses `ajv-cli` + `ajv-formats` + `js-yaml`.

### Added (2026-04-30 — docs: STORY_GUARD.md, 54d74d6)

- `STORY_GUARD.md` — standalone community pattern document for Story Guard: per-action scope checking using `get_active_story()` as a PostToolUse hook. Complete implementation guides for:
  - **Claude Code** — `.claude/settings.json` PostToolUse hook config (JSON, ready to paste).
  - **Cursor** — `.cursor/rules` implementation: read `stories.yaml`, find active story, check action scope before proceeding.
  - **Option 2 (no Prototyper account)** — local `stories.yaml` + `check-story.md` slash command, no web app required.
  - Community contribution matrix: Windsurf, Aider, GitHub Copilot (BYOK), Continue.dev — open for community PRs.

### Added (2026-05-01 — docs(story-guard): TL;DR entry point, 8addde0)

- `STORY_GUARD.md` — 3-line TL;DR block added at the top: one-sentence value prop and anchor nav links to Claude Code, Cursor, and local-file sections. Reduces time-to-find for cold GitHub visitors.

## Versioning contract

- **Patch** (e.g. 1.0.1): bug fixes, specification clarifications, documentation improvements. No schema changes.
- **Minor** (e.g. 1.1.0): new optional fields, new status values, new MCP tools. Backward compatible. Readers of v1.0 files can read v1.1 files without changes if they handle unknown fields gracefully.
- **Major** (e.g. 2.0.0): breaking changes — renamed fields, removed fields, changed field types. Migration tooling ships before or with any major version.

Current: **1.0.0 — Stable.**

---

## Design decisions (recorded here for stability)

**Why are required fields not restricted to the three most obvious ones (id, title, description)?**  
`section`, `priority`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `version` are required because audit tooling and agent context depend on them being present and typed. Making them optional would produce unreliable agent behaviour when they're missing.

**Why is `stale` a computed status, not hand-set?**  
`stale` is emitted by `audit_stories()` when `updated_at` predates recent changes to related source files. A human setting `stale` manually provides no signal that tooling can act on; a computed `stale` signals that re-review is warranted.

**Why is `acceptance_criteria` not in v1.0?**  
Shipping a stable v1.0 with a clean minimal field set is more important than completeness. The `description` field carries behavioural intent in v1.0 and is sufficient for Story Guard's scope-checking function. When `acceptance_criteria` lands in v1.1, Story Guard gains a more precise contract. The v1.0 → v1.1 migration is a mechanical addition of empty arrays — not a breaking change.

**Why YAML and not JSON as the canonical format?**  
Both are valid. YAML is the recommended authoring format because multiline strings (`>` block scalar) are significantly more ergonomic for `description` fields than JSON escaped strings. The schema is validated against a JSON Schema definition — machine consumption is sound; human authoring stays readable.
